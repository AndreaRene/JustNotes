# JustNotes

This leightweight application allows a user to post, save, and delete notes. 

Please note, this application is in it's early stage and the backend is very simple so any note you enter will be available to anyone with the link to see and delete. The current version is a work in progress. I'll be working on this feature at a later time.

You can find the deployed app[here](https://just-notes-app.herokuapp.com/)
